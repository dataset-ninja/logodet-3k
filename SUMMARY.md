**LogoDet-3K** is a dataset for an object detection task. It is used in the retail industry. 

The dataset consists of 158654 images with 194261 labeled objects belonging to 3000 different classes including *lexus-1*, *avery_dennison-2*, *alpinestars-2*, and other: *new_balance-1*, *76*, *maybach-1*, *mclaren*, *lexus-2*, *kichesippi-2*, *zendium*, *yuyue-2*, *nongfu_spring-2*, *longmu-1*, *longmu-2*, *square_one_organic*, *steeden*, *neil_pryde-2*, *new_balance-2*, *tiffany*, *kichesippi-1*, *yuyue-1*, *auxx-2*, *chow_tai_seng-1*, *thomapyrin*, *kleenex*, *jus-rol*, *paralen*, *music_man-2*, and 2972 more.

Images in the LogoDet-3K dataset have bounding box annotations. There are 4 (0% of the total) unlabeled images (i.e. without annotations). There are no pre-defined <i>train/val/test</i> splits in the dataset. Alternatively, the dataset could be split into 9 root-categories: ***food*** (53350 images), ***clothes*** (31266 images), ***necessities*** (24822 images), ***others*** (15513 images), ***transportation*** (10445 images), ***electronic*** (9675 images), ***leisure*** (5685 images), ***sports*** (3953 images), and ***medical*** (3945 images). The dataset was released in 2020 by the Shandong Normal University, China and Chinese Academy of Sciences.
